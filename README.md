# Weather Dashboard

## Main project goal

- The main goal of this app is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS

### Instructions

- Open the application

- Search for a city

- View current weather conditions for that city

  - UV Index color indicators follows WHO guidelines

- Click on a city in the search history

  - View current weather conditions for that city

## Installation

- No installation is required. The application may be viewed [here](https://vtaymany.github.io/weather_dashboard/)

## Roadmap

- The UI may be improved following best UI practices
- Since Moment.js is no longer supported by its developers it might be worth looking into other libraries
- OpenWeather is currently implementing a new API called 'One Call API' - at this current time it only supports coordinates
  - It would be a good idea to switch the whole application to use a single API call rather than 3
